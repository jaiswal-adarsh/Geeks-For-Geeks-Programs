ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 is going on and you need to make your own team. There are a total of n players available. You are also given the performance average of these n players in the form of an array arr[ ]. These average values are non-negative integers.

These n players are standing in a queue. You need to pick some players from the given n players to form your own team. The rules for selecting players are as follows :

At every step you select at most one player from the remaining players and who is not selected in previous rounds. (Remember, selecting a player does not remove him from the queue).
After every step, the first and last player in the remaining queue are removed. So, after the ith step (where i starts from1), ith player and (n - i+1) th player are removed from the queue.
We keep repeating this process until the queue becomes empty.
Your task is to select the players for your team in such a way that the sum of the average players of your team is the maximum possible.

 

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
arr[ ] =  [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
In first move, select player with index 4 (average = 4), then remove first and last player arr[ ] = [5, 2, 4], 
In second move, select player with index 1 (average = 5), then remove first and last player arr[ ] = [ 2 ],
In third move, select player with index 1 (average = 2), then remove first and last player arr[ ] = [  ],
Total sum of average = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11
 

Example 2:

Input:
n= 4
arr[ ] =  [1, 5, 5, 1]
Output: 10
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maximumSum() which takes the integer n, and 1D integer array arr[ ] as parameters and returns the maximum sum of the average of players of your team.

 

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤  105 
0 ≤ arri  ≤ 109
