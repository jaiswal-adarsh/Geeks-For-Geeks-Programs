Geek prepared N questions for developers hiring challenge of the GeeksforGeeks, but the hiring manager wants only one question in the contest and he asked geek to give the best problem out of N problems. Geek thinks that all the questions are best and he confused to choose a single problem. So, geek came with a game. Geek placed all the problems side by side from 1 to N. He takes out the first problem and inserts it at the end and removes the next first problem from the set. He repeats the same process until a single problem remains. The task is to find a single last problem.

Input:
1. The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
2. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.


Output: For each test case, print the last problem which remains

Constraints:
1. 1 <= T <= 100
2. 1 <= N <= 104

Example:
Input:
2
5
4

Output:
3
1

Explanation:
Test Case 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -> {3, 4, 5, 1} -> {5, 1, 3} -> {3, 5} -> {3}
