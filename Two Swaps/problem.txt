Given a permutation of first N natural numbers as an array A[ ]. Your task is to sort the array in exactly two swaps. If It is possible to sort the array then return True otherwise return False.

Note: You can swap same pair of index two times.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
A[] = {4, 3, 2, 1}
Output: Yes
Explanation: 
swap(A[1], A[4]), now A[] = {1, 3, 2, 4}
swap(A[2], A[3]), now A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
A[] = {4, 3, 1, 2}
Output: No
Explanation: 
Not possible to sort the array in 2 swaps.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function check() which takes the array A[ ] and its size N as input parameters and returns the boolean value True if it is possible to sort the array in exactly 2 swaps, otherwise returns False.

 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ N
