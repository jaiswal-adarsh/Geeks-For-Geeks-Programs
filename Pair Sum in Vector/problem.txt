Pairs and vectors can be used together to achieve some amazing results. Here we will learn to use a vector that holds pairs.
You are given a vector V of size n. The vector hold pair of integers. Example V={(1,2),(3,4)...}. Now, you need to sum the second elements.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
vector -> {(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), 
                     (7, 8), (9, 10)}
Output: 
30
Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the provided function sum(). In a new line, print the required output

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 107
0 <= Vi <= 107
