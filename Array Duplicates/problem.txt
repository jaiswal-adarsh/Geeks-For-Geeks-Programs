Given an array arr of size n which contains elements in range from 0 to n-1, you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array. Return the answer in ascending order. If no such element is found, return list containing [-1]. 

Note: Try and perform all operations within the provided array. The extra (non-constant) ) space needs to be used only for the array to be returned.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {0,3,1,2}, n = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no repeating element in the array. Therefore output is -1.
Input: arr[] = {2,3,1,2,3}, n = 5
Output: 2 3 
Explanation: 2 and 3 occur more than once in the given array.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).
