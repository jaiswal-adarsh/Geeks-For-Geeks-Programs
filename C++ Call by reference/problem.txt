Rahul loves to play with numbers, he challenges his friend Ankush with a problem related to numbers in which he has to first reverse the order of two digits and then swap them. Let us take the two digits as a and b.

Example 1:

Input:
a = 1234 
b = 67890
Output: 
9876 4321
Explanation: Reversing the given two numbers
will give: 4321 and 9876. After swapping it
would come as: 9876 and 4321.

Example 2:

Input:
a = 10000 
b = 3254
Output: 
4523 1
 

Your Task: Complete the two functions reverse_dig() and swap() with arguments as a and b references. Don't return anything to the function.

Constraints:
0 <= a, b <= 105
