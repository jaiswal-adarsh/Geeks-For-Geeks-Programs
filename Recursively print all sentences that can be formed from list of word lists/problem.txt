Given a list of word lists of size  M * N. The task is to return all sentences possible taking one word from a list at a time via recursion. 

Example 1:
Input:

L = {{"you", "we"},
     {"have", "are"},
Output: 
{{you have}
{you are}
{we have}
{we are}}
Explanation:
Consider every every word from the list and form
sentences with every other words, taking one word from a list .

Note: You need to maintain the order of the sentences.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sentences() which takes a matrix of strings as input and returns a matrix of string containing all possible sentences.

Expected Time Complexity: O(MN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(MN)

 

Constraints:
1 <= M, N <= 6
'a' <= sentence[i][j] <= 'z'
